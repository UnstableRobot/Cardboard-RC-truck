<h1>Cardboard-RC-truck</h1>
<h2>Why did I make this</h2>
I have for quite a while thought about getting more into RC.
However, The 1:14 scale trucks that interrest me the most are both expensive and very complex to build.
So after seing the Cardboard challenge on Instructables.com I was inspired to go to the complete opposite end of the scale compared to the expensive tamiya kits.
